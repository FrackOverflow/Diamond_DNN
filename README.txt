Hello Professor Harirpoush,

My DNN uses a tuner called "keras tuner", which tests a range of values for hyperparameters over a small number of epochs. 
If you want to avoid the added processing for parameter tuning (and use the exact same model I used) unzip the "keras_tuner.zip"
in the same directory as the python script and it will skip the tuning and use the presets from my tuning session. Otherwise,
tuning will run over my predefined ranges and the final result of the network may vary slightly, but should not be too different.


Thank you for taking the time to read this!
